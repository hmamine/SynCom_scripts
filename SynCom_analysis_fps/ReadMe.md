#R scripts to reproduce the analysis of microbial communities used in Hassani et al., 

#The scripts include alpha, beta and differentially abundance analyses of microbial communities for the flowpots example, and can be extended to count data from calcined clay system and liquid microcosms.  

#download raw data and then excute R scripts for flowpots community profiling example
